Description of assignment
===============

Using the ATMega2560 development board, the VIA Lego Interface board, at most two Lego motors, at
most two Lego sensors, Lego bricks and other Lego items, build a machine that can sort a pile of candy of
two different colours into two piles where each piece will have the same colour.

The solution must include a software program that uses one or perhaps two light sensors to control one or
perhaps two motors to achieve the sorting. The software must be written in two versions: one version in pure
handwritten assembler, and one version in C. The functionality of the two solutions must be the same.
